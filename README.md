The National AgriInnovate Hackathon at Global Fintech Fest (GFF) 2024 presented by NABARD and powered by Hack2skill seeks to revolutionize India's agricultural value chain through innovative digital solutions. 
Agri Value Chain Financing is an approach to identify financing needs and financing gaps throughout the chain and connects finance providers with all other nodes and ways to improve access to financing. However, linkages are not integrated into the value chain and credit does not flow across the Agri value chain. The challenge lies in developing a comprehensive digital tool that connects farmers, suppliers, buyers, financial institutions, and other stakeholders to address critical issues such as limited access to finance, poor market information, and inefficient value chain operations.
By enabling collaboration and innovation, this hackathon aims to empower farmers, enhance agricultural productivity, and drive sustainable rural development.
